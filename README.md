# Bootstrap Template (WordPress)

## Overview
This template was created in order to display a large amount of content to a user in a more interactive way. This was done using Bootstrap carousels and dropdown containers. 

I originally created this outside of WordPress as a one-off design for a specific school. This was done by hand-coding using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap 3. However, other Instructional Designers liked the design and so we created this as a WordPress template in order to reuse the framework. 

The work I do is owned by my current employer so this version of the site and code has been altered to hide proprietary information.

### Screenshots
Here's what the template looks like live. Again, using Lorem Ipsum to protect my employer's content.
