# Bootstrap Template (WordPress)

## Overview
This template was created in order to display a large amount of content to a user in a more interactive way. This was done using Bootstrap carousels and dropdown containers. We were also in need of a solution for a self-paced training or tutorial - again, a lot of content that a user could easily navigate through. We felt like this particular layout accomplished that by allowing users to navigate to whole sections vertically and then they could access the 'meat' of that section horizontally. 

I originally created this outside of WordPress as a one-off design for a specific school. This was done by hand-coding using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap 3. However, other Instructional Designers liked the design so we created this as a WordPress template in order to reuse/recycle the framework. 

The work I do is owned by my current employer so this version of the site and code has been altered to hide proprietary information.

### Screenshots
Here's what the template looks like live. Again, using Lorem Ipsum to protect my employer's content.
